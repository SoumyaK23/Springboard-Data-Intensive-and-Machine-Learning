These are the three ideas I would like to explore further for my capstone project:

Nutritional Values of food. 
The dataset for the analysis with 20000 recipes, with ingredients and calories.
Look in particular at calorific counts of organic and vegetarian food along with the protein, fat and sodium conent.
The hypothesis is of course that it is better in terms of calories to eat organic and vegetarian food.
This could further be used to suggest foods for customers based on diet requirements.

Race, Ethnicity and education in the US.
The dataset is from the US Census during the 1990s and the 200s.
I would like to investigate the trends between changes in race and ethinicity of counties in Massachusetts.
And then figure out how it relates to education. Are there areas with big changes and has it impacted education.
Since education determines house prices, this would be a very good analysis which can predict future trends.

Recommendation system for online retail shop
The dataset is from University of Irvine and consists of retail data including country and customerID for varioud products.
I would like to see of there any patterns in the purchasing habits- by products or customers.
This can be used to recommend products to potential or existing customers.
